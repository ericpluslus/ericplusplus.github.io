# Welcome to EricPlusPlus's blog!

This blog mainly serves two purposes:
1) A Collection of tips and guides around my hobbies that I find to be useful for others. I spent a lot of time giving the same advice, and creating a post not only saves me time but allows for the information to be more complete.
2) Reviews, reflection, and thoughts of what I am reading, working on, or interested in.
